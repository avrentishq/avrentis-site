/**
 * The marketing words for each plan — its one-line description, its curated
 * highlights and the comparison table's feature labels — for the build-time
 * pricing fallback (`src/lib/pricing-fallback-build.ts`).
 *
 * WHY THIS LIVES HERE. Core's plan catalogue holds every FACT about a plan
 * (name, prices, capacity, features, how it is sold) and deliberately no display
 * copy: copy is each consumer's own catalogue. The live pricing API serves the
 * app's copy; this is the site's, used only when the API is unreachable on a
 * cold cache. The site is English-only (no i18n layer), so plain strings.
 *
 * NO FIGURES. Every number a line states — seats, documents, storage,
 * retention — is passed in from core's capacity and formatted by
 * `@/lib/plan-limits`, so a capacity change in core reaches this copy with no
 * edit. Module names are core's too. Keyed by `PlanKey`, so a plan added to
 * core fails the type check here until it has words.
