/**
 * Copy for the four SUITE pages (`/product/<suite>`).
 *
 * These pages exist because the navigation stopped listing eight modules and
 * started listing four suites: a visitor now arrives at a group and has to be
 * told, in one page, what the modules in it have in common and what each one
 * uniquely adds — then sent on to the module's own page for the detail.
 *
 * WHAT GOES WHERE. `shared` is the half that used to be repeated, slightly
 * differently, on every module page: one delegation-of-authority engine, one
 * permanent record, one set of permissions. `modules[key]` is the half that is
 * true of exactly one module — if a line here would read as true of its
 * neighbour, it belongs in `shared` instead.
 *
 * The brand rule applies to the hero (name the outcome, never the feature); the
 * module blocks below it are the product tier, where naming the thing is right.
 *
 * EVERY public module in a suite needs an entry: `suite-pages.lock.test.ts`
 * fails otherwise, so a new module cannot ship into a suite with no words.
